# A Hausdorff–packing criterion for self-pinned distance sets

A Lean 4 formalization project for Theorem 1.1 of the manuscript *Self-pinned distance sets: a
Hausdorff–packing dimension criterion* (19 September 2026).

For a Borel set $E \subseteq \mathbb{R}^2$ write $\Delta_y(E) = \{|x-y| : x \in E\}$, put

$$d_0 = \frac{9+\sqrt{33}}{12}, \qquad d_1 = \frac{5+\sqrt{97}}{12},$$

and define, for $1 < d \le 5/4$,

$$
B(d) =
\begin{cases}
2d-1,
  & 1 < d \le d_0, \\[4pt]
3d^2 - \dfrac52 d,
  & d_0 < d \le d_1, \\[8pt]
\dfrac{(2d-1)^2 + \sqrt{(2d-1)^4+8d}}{4},
  & d_1 < d \le \dfrac54.
\end{cases}
$$

**Theorem 1.1.** If $E \subseteq \mathbb{R}^2$ is Borel, $d = \dim_H E \in (1, 5/4]$ and
$\dim_P E < B(d)$, then $|\Delta_y(E)| > 0$ for some $y \in E$.

The pin lies in $E$ itself, no compactness or regularity is assumed, and the packing inequality
is strict, including at the two transition points.

## Status

The **checked theorem is the conditional form of Theorem 1.1** (Section 4 of the manuscript):
the two analytic criteria enter as explicit hypotheses, and the theorem is the branch
combination that derives the curve `B(d)` from them. That combination is fully proved, so the
comparator's axiom report is `[propext, Classical.choice, Quot.sound]`.

Unconditional Theorem 1.1 is recorded in `Challenge.lean` as `Target` and is **not proved**: it
needs the original branch (Proposition 2.5) and the finite-profile branch (Theorem 3.1), whose
formalization requires Orponen's radial-projection theorem, GIOW packet localization, tube
deletion, the inflation step, the pinned identity, the shell bounds and the joint limit —
modules 7 to 14 of the manuscript's ledger, none of which exists in Mathlib. A green comparator
here certifies the conditional theorem, nothing more.

## Layout

| path | contents |
|---|---|
| `Challenge.lean` | the statement, self-contained, with the theorem hole |
| `Solution.lean` | the target theorem, in the same form, proved from the library |
| `FalconerPacking/Statement.lean` | the same definitions, for the modular development |
| `FalconerPacking/Algebra.lean` | the curve algebra of Section 4 |
| `FalconerPacking/Dimensions.lean` | module 1: the covering definitions against Mathlib's `dimH` |
| `FalconerPacking/Profile.lean` | module 3: finite profiles, edge costs, Lemmas 3.2 and 3.3 |
| `FalconerPacking/Dyadic.lean` | module 4: the dyadic cube hierarchy of the plane |
| `FalconerPacking/Energy.lean` | module 6: Frostman measures, Riesz kernels and finite energy |
| `FalconerPacking/Restriction.lean` | module 4: normalized restrictions and their Frostman bounds |
| `FalconerPacking/Extraction.lean` | module 15: the selection and separation steps of the reduction |
| `FalconerPacking/Content.lean` | Hausdorff content, towards Frostman's lemma |
| `FalconerPacking/FrostmanWeights.lean` | the finite Frostman normalization on the cube tree |
| `FalconerPacking/WeightMeasure.lean` | normalized atomic measures and their cube and ball bounds |
| `FalconerPacking/OccupiedCubes.lean` | finite occupied covers and support-point selection for compact sets |
| `FalconerPacking/WeakLimit.lean` | compactness, subsequences, and preservation of dyadic ball bounds in the weak limit |
| `FalconerPacking/FrostmanLimit.lean` | conversion from dyadic estimates to a genuine Frostman measure on a compact set |
| `FalconerPacking/PinnedMeasure.lean` | pinned distance pushforwards and the absolute-continuity-to-positive-length implication |
| `FalconerPacking/LocalEnergy.lean` | scale-sensitive bounds and geometric summability for normalized dyadic restrictions |
| `FalconerPacking/Main.lean` | the branch combination |
| `comparator.json` | permits only `propext`, `Quot.sound`, `Classical.choice` |

`comparator.json` has no `definition_names` escape hatch: the definitions reachable from the
statement — `packingDim`, `upperBoxDim`, `HasUpperBoxBound`, `pinnedDistances`, `bound`, `d0`,
`d1` — are compared recursively, so they cannot be restated or weakened in the solution.

## Definitions used by the statement

`dimH` is Mathlib's Hausdorff dimension. Packing dimension is not in Mathlib at the pinned
revision, so `packingDim` is defined here by the standard bounded countable-cover
characterization, over the covering-based `upperBoxDim`. A comparator that fixes a different
reference definition of packing dimension requires a proved equivalence; substituting
`upperBoxDim E` for `packingDim E` is not admissible, as the two disagree even for compact sets.

## Building

```bash
lake exe cache get
lake build FalconerPacking Challenge Solution
```

Pinned to Lean and Mathlib `v4.32.0` (Mathlib revision `81a5d257`). The `comparator` job of the
[Lean build workflow](.github/workflows/build.yml) builds the challenge and the solution inside
the `landrun` sandbox on a fresh runner and checks the statements and the axiom list.
